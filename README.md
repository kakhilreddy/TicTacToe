# TicTacToe

Hi everyone.

Tic Tac Toe ,who doesnt know it??
It is the favourite game of every student which turns a boring class lecture into serious battle between friends.
Lol!! Yes it is.... 
Hi I am akhil, I always wanted to know how these app developers built such games,as soon as I learnt Android App development ,I tried to 
make Tic Tac Toe game and i successfully implemented Tic Tac Toe like this:-
###**One Player option Coming soon
For any game we need a cool menu right?
I added a Background which i downloaded from Google Images and then set it as a background to layout.Then i added 2 imageView buttons for 
one player and  two player
Then i added some cool music by creating a MediaPlayer object

**Menu**

After selecting any option (One Player or Two Player)
User is directed to tic tac toe board, i used TableLayout to set up the board
